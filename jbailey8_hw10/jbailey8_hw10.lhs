Add your code to this file.  You will need to remove the spaces before ">" for the types to become part of your code.

The following 3 problems introduce the idea of currying (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying).
Problem 1:  Given the following definition of s2:

> s2 = (+)

To make things easy use the prefix notation for the operators.   For example: (*) 3 2 would evaluator to 6. 
What is the type of s2?  What is it's value in words.

s2 is an operator type that takes an Integer and another Integer and returns an Integer

Problem 2:  Given the following definition of s1:

> s1 = s2 99

What is the type of s2?  What is it's value in words.   What is the value of
10 applied to s1 ? (i.e) > s1 10
Problem 2 Answer:

I assume you mean the type of s1, since we already answered the type of s2 above.  s1 is an operation that takes an
Integer and returns an Integer that has applied the s2 operation and 99 to it.  The value of s1 10 is 109 as expected

Problem 3:

Write a function "sumAll" that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.  This must be a recursive solution.

Problem 3 Answer:

> sumALL :: Num a => [a] -> a
> sumALL [] = 0
> sumALL (x:xs) = x + sumALL xs 



Problem 4:

Write a function "binOpALL op lst" that takes a binary operator and a list of numbers and returns the result of appling the 'op' to the values in list.   

Problem 4 Answer:

> binOpALL :: Num a => (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> a
> binOpALL _ [] = 0
> binOpALL (op) (x:xs) = (x) `op` (binOpALL op xs)


Problem 5:
Write a recursive function "insertAt v p lst" that inserts a value v at position p in list lst. 
If p is greater than the length of lst, simply insert it at the end.

Remember, Haskell is "pure", so you may not modify ls. Instead, you should recurse and build a new list from ls with v inserted. 

Problem 5 Answer:

> insertAt :: (Eq a, Num a) => b -> a -> [b] -> [b]
> insertAt v 0 lst = [v] ++ lst
> insertAt v p [] = [] ++ [v]
> insertAt v p (head:rest) = [head] ++ insertAt v (p-1) rest


Problem 6.
Define a function composeList which composes a list of functions into a single function. Assume the list of functions is not empty.  Define composeList using primitive recursion.
  

    ...> composeList [ (*) 2, (*) 2] 2
    8
    ...> composeList [ (-) 3 , (*) 2, (+)5 ] 7 
    -21


Problem 6 Answer:

> composeList [] n = n
> composeList lst n = composeList (init lst) (last lst n)



Problem 7: (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence )
"In mathematics, the Thue-Morse sequence, or Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence, is a 
binary sequence that begins:

  0 01 0110 01101001 0110100110010110 01101001100101101001011001101001 ...

(if your sequence starts with one..)
    1 10 1001 10010110 1001011001101001...."

...
"Characterization using bitwise negation

The Thueâ€“Morse sequence in the form given above, as a sequence of bits, 
can be defined recursively using the operation of bitwise negation. So, the 
first element is 0. Then once the first 2n elements have been specified, 
forming a string s, then the next 2n elements must form the bitwise negation of 
s. Now we have defined the first 2n+1 elements, and we recurse.

Spelling out the first few steps in detail:

    * We start with 0.
    * The bitwise negation of 0 is 1.
    * Combining these, the first 2 elements are 01.
    * The bitwise negation of 01 is 10.
    * Combining these, the first 4 elements are 0110.
    * The bitwise negation of 0110 is 1001.
    * Combining these, the first 8 elements are 01101001.
    * And so on.
So
    * T0 = 0.
    * T1 = 01."
    
Define a primitive recursive function 'thue' given the nth thue element returns
the next thue element.  The elements will be represented as a list of 0s and 1s.
e.g.
   HW10> thue [0,1,1,0]
   [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]


Problem 7 Answer:

> flipBits [] = []
> flipBits (x:xs)
>	| x == 0 = [1] ++ flipBits xs
>	| x == 1 = [0] ++ flipBits xs

> thue :: (Eq a, Num a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]
> thue lst = lst ++ (flipBits lst)



Problem 7:
Define a function replicate' which given a list of numbers returns a 
list with each number duplicated its value.   Use primitive recursion in your
definition. You may use a nested helper definition. eg.
     
     HW10> replicate' [2, 4, 1]
     [2,2,4,4,4,4,1]

Problem 7 Answer:

> replicateHelper n 0 = []
> replicateHelper n p = [n] ++ (replicateHelper n (p-1))

> replicate' :: (Eq a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]
> replicate' [] = []
> replicate' (x:xs) = (replicateHelper x x) ++ (replicate' xs)



Problem 8: 
Implement Newton's method for calculating the square root of N. Your definition should use primitive recursive style.  See (http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/HW/Haskell1S18.html) webpage for definition of Newton method for the approximation of roots. 
 Your definition should include a user defined (input) "guess" value and a user defined "nearEnough" value.  
"nearEnough" is use to determine when the guess is close enough to the square root.  (guess*guess = number) 
You should use locally defined helper functions to make your code more readable. You may use guards or "if expression"

e.g. 
   Haskell1> newtonAppr 144 1 0.1             
   12.000545730742438 
   Haskell1> newtonAppr 144 1 0.0001
   12.0000000124087
   Haskell1> newtonAppr 144 1 0.000000000000001
   12.0
Haskell1> newtonAppr 5e+30 1 1000000000000000000000000000000
   2.317148867384728e15
   Haskell1> newtonAppr 5e+30 1 100000000000000000000000000    
   2.2360684271923805e15

Problem 8 Answer:
Note you may have a slightly different type depending on your solution.

> newtonAppr :: (Floating a, Fractional a, Ord a) => a -> a -> a -> a
> newtonAppr n g ne
>	| g >= (sqrt n) - ne && g <= (sqrt n) + ne = g
>	| otherwise = newtonAppr n ((g + n / g) / 2) ne
